## Salad Ordering Demo

A sleek food ordering UI/UX written in pure **SwiftUI** with custom animations.

#### Demo

The hardest part of this layout was the custom animation and ensuring it followed responsive design practices for all screen sizes.<br>

*This was especially difficult since all items in the circle animation are pre-rendered in a circle formation off screen, so using a **VStack** was not possible. Thankfully, **GeometryReader** came to the rescue.*<br>

#### Overall Design

The overall UI design was alright, very few changes were made to the original mockups since this demo was created for a speed challenge from another user's figma designs. <br>

*The slide-out menu is lacking details such as item names and quantity in cart, but those things are easy to add.*<br>

#### Conclusion

This was a fun intermediate delve into iOS development using SwiftUI. Maybe I'll create a more detailed write-up in a tutorial style if I find the time.<br>
